- [Release 1.5.1](https://github.com/bootc-dev/bootc/pull/1422)
  - Thanks @robert!
- {{speaker(name="Laura")}} project pavilion update?
  - Request form due Monday, shouldn't block on travel
  - Let's do it live
  - âœ…
- {{speaker(name="Laura")}} Static site generation for landing page
  - Review!
  - [bootc-dev/bootc-dev.github.io#3](https://github.com/bootc-dev/bootc-dev.github.io/pull/3)
  - adding logos as examples: [CoreOS site](https://fedoraproject.org/coreos/); [BluefinOS](https://projectbluefin.io/)
- {{speaker(name="Colin")}} QMU banned contributions from AI. Want to talk about it. Contribution policy?
  - Thoughts?
  - Require use of `<Assisted-by>` tag to identify model/tool
  - Errant AI comment contributed to recent bug
  - {{speaker(name="John")}} +1 on attribution
  - {{speaker(name="Dusty")}} do we want to limit, or allow?
    - {{speaker(name="Colin")}} has a pretty big impact, so want to know what folks think
  - {{speaker(name="Joseph")}} note in readme or contributing section makes sense. Maybe have a bot that highlights that on PR? People probably won't say anything because part of workflow
  - {{speaker(name="Dusty")}} Can't prevent, but policy. Any examples of wasted time on clearly generated by AI PR
    - {{speaker(name="Colin")}} Can tell 90% of the time. Most modern foundational models love bulleted lists, so it's obvious. Kinda wacky to put md doc in top level of repo for PR
    - {{speaker(name="Laura")}} gave overview from OSPO and the other container group discussion
  - {{speaker(name="Colin")}} Will open a discussion

### TODO:
- [ ] Laura to explore adding logos to PR.
- [ ] Laura to add GitHub Actions for publication
- [ ] Look for info on domain handling for static site
- [ ] Colin to open a discussion about the AI assisted PRs
- [x] Laura to find and share the public Containers Cabal recording
