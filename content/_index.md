Transactional, in-place operating system updates using OCI/Docker container images.

## Motivation

The original Docker container model of using "layers" to model applications has been extremely successful. This project aims to apply the same technique for bootable host systems - using standard OCI/Docker containers as a transport and delivery format for base operating system updates.

The container image includes a Linux kernel (in e.g. `/usr/lib/modules`), which is used to boot. At runtime on a target system, the base userspace is *not* itself running in a "container" by default. For example, assuming systemd is in use, systemd acts as pid1 as usual---there's no "outer" process. More about this in the docs; see below.

## Status

The CLI and API are considered stable. We will ensure that every existing system can be upgraded in place seamlessly across any future changes.

## Documentation

The project documentation is hosted on a different site: [Docs](https://bootc-dev.github.io/bootc/)

## Versioning

Although bootc is not released to crates.io as a library, version numbers are expected to follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) standards. This practice began with the release of version 1.2.0; versions prior may not adhere strictly to semver standards.

## Adopters (base and end-user images)

The bootc CLI is just a client system; it is not tied to any particular operating system or Linux distribution. You very likely want to actually start by looking at [ADOPTERS.md](about/adopters).

## Community discussion

- [Github discussion forum](https://github.com/containers/bootc/discussions) for async discussion
- [#bootc-dev on CNCF Slack](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C08SKSQKG1L) for live chat
- Recurring live meeting hosted on [CNCF Zoom](https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meeting/96540875093?password=7889708d-c520-4565-90d3-ce9e253a1f65) each Friday at 15:30 UTC.

This project is also currently tightly related to the previously mentioned Fedora/CentOS bootc project, and many developers monitor the relevant discussion forums there. In particular, there's a Matrix channel and a weekly chat meeting; [learn more](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/bootc/community/).
